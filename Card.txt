// Attribute Base 计算公式
Cofficient * (PreMultiplyAdditiveValue + Attribute) + PostMultiplyAdditiveValue

AttackRange:
In Eveny Character, we add "InsightIntensity", default value = 1.0f
when in card attack range find function, we use card attack range multiply by this intensity value to get final attack range

PlayerControllerState:
...
PlayerPrepareAttackState:
only use PreviewCardSkill -> {
1. play character preview anim
2. find attack path
}

PlayerAttackState:
only use CardSkill

fix:
1. remove card logic and card logic ability task, and use playpapermontage and gameplay ability instead.(1)
2. consider to add character insight intensity attribute, when calc character's find path range or card attack range, we use this attribut mutlity by range.(3)
3. learn unreal ai system, try move enemy behaviour to behaviour tree .(2)


about AI:
1. add GridAITurnActionManager class
	1. ActiveAITurnAction
	2. StartCurrentAIUnitTurn
	3. EndCurrentAIUnitTurn

2. for every enemy unit, add AIController
	1. when GridAITurnActionManager::StartCurrentAIUnitTurn call, Set Blackbroad value "bInAIControlProgress" to ture
	2. run behavior tree logic
	3. when end action call, set "bInAIControlProgress" to false
